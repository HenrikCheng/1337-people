Hej och välkomna,
Jag vet inte vilket språk ni föredrar så hädanefter så skriver jag på engelska.

Greeting and welcome,
Who am I?
My name is Henrik Cheng and this is my assignment for Tretton37.

What does the product do?
Using this product, you are able to see, sort and filter all the employees at your company.

Thoughts about the design?
My idea when making this was to make it simple, light weight, and easy to build upon. App.js contains the api-call and renders the component which receives props from their parent components.

Which packages did you use and why?
TailwindCSS - In order to make an attractive webpage fast, that can still be unique in appearence, I think Tailwind is great.
SWR & Axios - I think SWR and Axios are an easy to understand and yet powerful tools.
Font Awesome - Huge repository for icons.
I was thinking of using Formik for the form-section, but I think it would have been overkill for this application at this point.

Which stories did you select & why?
Responsive design - I choose this because I think it's important that a modern product can be accessed with a plethora of devices.
Sort by name and office - I choose this to show my understanding of react and javascript
Filter by name and office - Same reason as above
Enable switch between grid and toggle - Show skills, and I think it's important from an UI perspective
Available from free public url - I think it's fun to show friends and family my projects, this is the simplest way. This project I will obviously not show to anyone.
Use Typescript or similar, no anys - I used React Proptypes for my type-checking. I have worked with TS in my previous job, but not recently, so I can do it again. I choose not to do it here because the time window was 3-6 hours.

Can I surf there right now?
Yes, it's deployed here: https://henrikcheng.github.io/1337-people/

How and where can I download it?
You can clone the repository from "https://github.com/HenrikCheng/1337-people", here's the direct link "https://github.com/HenrikCheng/1337-people". You can also download the repo as a zip-file. I am not very active on this account, so please don't judge me to harshly on some other projects here...

Thank you for your consideration.
I hope you find my profile interesting and I hope you'd be interested in meeting me. I am happy to answer any question that may arise.

Regards
Henrik Cheng
