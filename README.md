Hej och välkomna,<br/>
Jag vet inte vilket språk ni föredrar så hädanefter så skriver jag på engelska.<br/><br/>

Greeting and welcome,<br/>
Who am I?<br/>
My name is Henrik Cheng and this is my assignment for Tretton37.<br/><br/>

What does the product do?<br/>
Using this product, you are able to see, sort and filter all the employees at your company.<br/><br/>

Thoughts about the design?<br/>
My idea when making this was to make it simple, light weight, and easy to build upon. App.js contains the api-call and renders the component which receives props from their parent components.<br/><br/>

Which packages did you use and why?<br/>
TailwindCSS - In order to make an attractive webpage fast, that can still be unique in appearence, I think Tailwind is great.<br/>
SWR & Axios - I think SWR and Axios are an easy to understand and yet powerful tools.<br/>
Font Awesome - Huge repository for icons.<br/>
I was thinking of using Formik for the form-section, but I think it would have been overkill for this application at this point.<br/><br/>

Which stories did you select & why?<br/>
Responsive design - I choose this because I think it's important that a modern product can be accessed with a plethora of devices.<br/>
Sort by name and office - I choose this to show my understanding of react and javascript<br/>
Filter by name and office - Same reason as above<br/>
Enable switch between grid and toggle - Show skills, and I think it's important from an UI perspective<br/>
Available from free public url - I think it's fun to show friends and family my projects, this is the simplest way. This project I will obviously not show to anyone.<br/>
Use Typescript or similar, no anys - I used React Proptypes for my type-checking. I have worked with TS in my previous job, but not recently, so I can do it again. I choose not to do it here because the time window was 3-6 hours.<br/><br/>

Can I surf there right now?<br/>
Yes, it's deployed here: https://henrikcheng.github.io/1337-people/<br/>

How and where can I download it?<br/>
You can clone the repository from "[https://github.com/HenrikCheng/1337-people](https://github.com/HenrikCheng/1337-people/tree/master)". You can also download the repo as a zip-file. I am not very active on this account, so please don't judge me to harshly on some other projects here...<br/><br/>

Any more thoughts?<br/>
I know I've stored the api-key publicly. I considered storing it in an ".env-file" and add it to git ignore. However, then you wouldn't have been able to run it locally. You could still find the api-key in the network tab in the browser from what I gather. I know that the proper way is to call for a token with the api-key from backend. <br/><br/>

Thank you for your consideration.<br/>
I hope you find my profile interesting and I hope you'd be interested in meeting me. I am happy to answer any question that may arise.<br/><br/>

Regards<br/>
Henrik Cheng
